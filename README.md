## Aim

This project aims to divide boxes into three different sizes into three containers, each size in a container.
- Box1: 10x10x10 cm
- Box2: 20x20x20 cm
- Box3: 30x30x30 cm

## Method

Changing the direction of two of the boxes was the main idea to approach the aim.
And to do so, two bars attached to an inclined surface had been used.

The height of the first inclined was modified to reach only box3 (between 21-30 cm from the conveyor belt), and the second was modified to reach for box2 (between 11-20 cm from the conveyor belt).
